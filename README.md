App build with `expo`, `react native` and `jsonplaceholder` to administrate albums and its photos

The app consists of 3 pages:

- **Home page**: All albums are listed. The user can enter the page of each album or enter the photo page directly. The user can also slide the photos to see the first 9 photos of each album.

- **Album page**: Displays all the album photos. Click on each of them to go to its photo page.

- **Photo page**: Displays the photo with its title. If you click on the photo you will be able to zoom in and see it with more detail. To exit the full screen mode, you have to slide-down.

## Installation and usage

Download the code and run `yarn install` and `yarn start`. You can use the expo app to test it on your own phone by scanning the code that appears on the terminal / your browser. See the [expo documentation](https://docs.expo.io/) for more information.
